# PasswordGenerator
Simple random password generator that works on the command line. 

Only tested on **Mac**, but should work for other operating systems as well.

## Modification

To modify the password generation output, just look up the ascii table
which has 128 indexes (0-127). 
The borders in line 18 can be used for example to make sure that 
the passwords only exists of letters.
